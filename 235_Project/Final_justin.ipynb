    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to know how long players in various positions can expect to remain competitive in the NHL. We were specifically interested in how quickly player reach their peak performance, the age at which they peak, and how quickly different aspects of their performance declines with age. To accomplish this we decided to collect 5 seasons worth of skater and goalie data from pro-hockey-reference.com from 2018-2024. We then picked certain performance metrics and plotted them vs. age with a LOESS smoother to examine performance with increasing age.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 players on the ice at a given time. These consist of three offensive players (center, left wing, right wing), two defense men, and a goalie. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Acquisition and Cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "We collected the player and goalie data for each season as .txt files and read them into python. We then completed some exploratory data analysis and concluded that some of the player positions were labeled inconsitently. For example, some players were labeled as Forwards, while others were labeled as Centers despite this being the same position. We also found that some players filled multiple roles leading them to have multiple positions included. To fix this we created indicator variables for each position so that players who played multiple positions would be included in the graphs for each of those positions. With this cleaning complete we created an overall skater and overal goalie data frames containing the entire time series of data. With the collection and cleaning complete we moved on to picking performance metrics and plotting. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Performance Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Goalies:\n",
    "* Save Percentage (SV%): Saves/ Total Shots\n",
    "* Goals Against Average (GAA): Total Goals Allowed per hour of play time.\n",
    "* Goals Saved Above Average (GSAA): Number of goals saved above league average given the number of shot attempts.\n",
    "* Goalie Point Shares (GPS): Estimated number of points contributed to team total due to defensive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skaters:\n",
    "* Relative Corsi Percentage (CF%rel): Measures players impact on team puck posession and influence the number of shot attempts\n",
    "* Plus/Minus (+/-): Goals for - Goals against (while teams are at even strength).\n",
    "* Goals Plus Assists: Number of goals for + number of asissts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Plotting and LOESS\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to employ LOESS (Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing) to capture any trend in player performance. We employed the lowess() function from the statsmodels package and then also used boostrap sampling to calculated a 95% confidence interval. There is a smoothing parameter in the LOESS model, which we called frac_val, that controls how much of the surrounding data is used to shape the curve. A large smoothing parameter results in more of the surrounding data being considered as the curve is shaped. This means that it is less sensitive to outliers but may not be flexible enough to capture the relationship. On the other hand a small smoothing parameter ($\\approx$ 0.1) makes the curve much more flexible, making it better equpped to capture local detail. However this can also make it prone to overfitting as we will see. \n",
